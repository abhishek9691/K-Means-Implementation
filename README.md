# K-Means-Implementation

A basic K-Means algorithm implementation using PHP so that it can be run from any apache server. The centroids for the algorithm is hard coded into the PHP file, and the program outputs the number of iterations required with the given centroid (k), and the resulting clusters as well. This algorithm was used to analyze the MNIST data set for handwritten digits (provided as vector quantities). The algorithm successfully matched most of the data pieces correctly (1 with 1, 2 with 2, sometimes 2 with 5), but the PHP file runs a bit slow and could be sped up.
